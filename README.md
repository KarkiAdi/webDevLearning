# webDevLearning
This repository keeps a weekly track of all the new concepts that I learn in my `Full Stack Web Development` journey. 
I will be using technologies like `HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap5, ES6, Node.js, Express, React.js, Next.js, SQL and MongoDB`

The projects inside this repository is inspired by two Udemy courses:
1. `The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp` by Dr. Angela Yu
2. `The Modern React Bootcamp` by Colt Steele
